  [pelle]

  [davismr]

  [claytron]

1.3 (2010-02-11)

- Use `setSite` in the `plonesite.py` script so that the component
  architecture gets initialized properly. This will allow the

  [clayton]

1.2 (2010-02-10)
================

- Update docs with info about how to add a `Product`

  avoid some strange behavior.
  [claytron]

  [toutpt]

1.0 (2009-08-24)
================

- Added a ``before-install`` and ``after-install`` option to the recipe. this
  allows you to use something like supervisor to launch the processes.
  Thanks to Shane Hathaway for the patch.
  [claytron]

0.9 (2009-08-10)
================

- Fixed the ``site-id`` option so that it defaults to ``Plone`` properly.

- Fixed the ``instance`` option so that it defaults to ``instance`` properly
  [claytron]

0.6 (2008-12-16)
================

- Make ``admin-user`` configuration option truly optional per the documentation.  
  Fallback to ``admin`` which would be the common default per ZopeSkel's
  plone3_buildout template
  [andrewb]

- Added new options ``pre-extras`` and ``post-extras``.  The two options are files that
  can be run before and after the quickinstaller and profiles have been run.
  [claytron]

- Add condition so that the script can be used on older versions of plone
  [claytron]

0.5 (2008-11-11)

  off from the command line. (``buildout:parts-=plonesite`` doesn't

  also be given.

- The ``site-replace`` option is no longer required
  [claytron]

0.2 (2008-10-30)
================

- new Plone sites will be created with a datetime suffix
  which is helpful if you need to re-run new instances
  over and over again e.g. for migration purposes. If you
  need a fixed site id then explictely set the id using
  the ``site-id`` option.
  [ajung]

- Fixed error with uninitialized variable
  [jeffk]

- Add buildout recipe option site-replace, defaults to
  off. Use with ``site-id``.

  New recipe option ``site-replace = on`` will remove any
  existing object in app named ``site-id``. A new plone site
  will be created to replace it.

  Default option setting ``site-replace = off`` will not remove
  existing objects in app named site-id.
  [jeffk]
