0.2 (2008-10-30)
================

- new Plone sites will be created with a datetime suffix
  which is helpful if you need to re-run new instances
  over and over again e.g. for migration purposes. If you
  need a fixed site id then explictely set the id using
  the ``site-id`` option.
  [ajung]

- Fixed error with uninitialized variable
  [jeffk]

- Add buildout recipe option site-replace, defaults to
  off. Use with ``site-id``.

  New recipe option ``site-replace = on`` will remove any
  existing object in app named ``site-id``. A new plone site
  will be created to replace it.

  Default option setting ``site-replace = off`` will not remove
  existing objects in app named site-id.
  [jeffk]
