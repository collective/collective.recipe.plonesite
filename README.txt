Introduction
============

This recipe enables you to create and update a Plone site as part of a buildout run.  This recipe only aims to run profiles and Quickinstall products.  It is assumed that the install methods, setuphandlers, upgrade steps, and other recipes will handle the rest of the work.

NOTE: There is another recipe that does something very similar here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.updateplone
